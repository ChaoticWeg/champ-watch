###### Note, as you read: e-mail functionality is not live yet.

ChampWatch allows you to quickly check to see which champs are free for the week, and to select champs to watch to get e-mail alerts whenever they are free to play.

The e-mail alerts are optional, of course, and can be opted-out of at any time. (Note: at this time, e-mail functionality is not live.)
